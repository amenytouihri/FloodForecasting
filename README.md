# FloodForecasting

**Description**

Floods are the most frequent natural disasters caused by an overflow of water. They have immediate impacts such as loss of human life, deterioration of health conditions, and mainly property damage, especially agricultural lands. That's why floods represent a threat to the farmers. Flood forecasting is a way to reduce damage casualties. In this project, we will use a rainfall dataset that the ministry of agriculture in Tunisia provides to try and find a correlation between rainfall and the occurrence of floods in Tunisia. 

We will train the model using different algorithms such as Markov's chain, RNN, LSTM then we will try to find the most fitted model in our case.
